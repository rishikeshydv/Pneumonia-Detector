I performed this project under the mentorship of Mr. Bal Krishna Nyaupane, Assistant Professor at IOE, Tribhuwan University. <br />
Kaggle dataset has been used to train the model. To improve training and validation accuracy, fine-tuning of Visual Geometry Group (VGG) pre-trained modes are conducted with different hyperparameters. The deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based on VGG-16 and VGG-19 architectures are used to extract features from given chest X-ray images. These features are then used for classification. In addition to the accuracy and F1-score as an evaluation matrix, the results of pre-trained models are compared using the model loss, and model accuracy graphs. The model's performance in detecting pneumonia demonstrates that the proposed VGG pre-trained model can efficiently categorize normal and pneumonia chest X-rays images in practice. As a result, the proposed model can be utilized to make a speedy diagnosis of pneumonia and can assist radiologists with their work.
